You: Or the day after.
You: Or the day after that.
Farmer Jill: I get it, doll. But what made you want to thank me?
You: It's about time people started thanking you.
You: And I still want to be able to easily get food.
Farmer Jill: You didn't have to.
Farmer Jill: I should thank you.
Farmer Jill: Without the roads you build, I wouldn't have been able to deliver my crop.
You: I guess backbones have backbones.
Farmer Jill: I guess we all do. Don't forget to thank the people you rely on, doll.
You: I won't.
Farmer Jill and I had a heart to heart.
I feel like I'm as close as I'll ever be with Farmer Jill.
